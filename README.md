## Installation

* Download via zip file
* Go to the TimerApp folder
* Run the .exe file

## Modern Look? It Comes with a Catch!

Looks good right? There is a catch. The thing is, if I chose an ordinary timer without any of this XAML design, this program would be working as much as I wanted it to be. But who wants a timer with a boring design aight? This in turn limited the opportunities of the app but don't worry, I will add more features soon.

## Limitations

* Has a time limit of ONLY 4 minute 55 seconds. (approx 5 minutes)
* Once started and clicked again, it will reset back to normal instead of pausing with the current progress bar.
* Does not have a sound to notify the user once the timer has finished.

## Soon to be Features

* Add an option to choose from a wide variety of time limit (30 secs, 1 min, 5 mins, 15 mins, 30 mins, 60 mins will be the only options)
* The pause method
* A sound to notify the user
* Add a focus session and break session

## NOTE TO ME IN THE FUTURE

Don't forget, the assets build should be renamed from "none" to "Resource". Also, I haven't uploaded these files yet but you don't really need them to play the app:

* Bin Debug
* Bin Release
* obj Debug
* obj Release
